## 2.3 How to Run a Demo

ComPDFKit PDF SDK for Windows provides one demo in C# for developers to learn how to call the SDK on Windows. You can find them in the ***"ComPDFKit.Demo"*** folder. In this guide, it takes the "C#" demo as an example to show how to run it in Visual Studio 2017.

1. Double-click the ***"ComPDFKit.Demo.sln"*** found in the ***"ComPDFKit.Demo"*** folder to open the demo in Visual Studio 2017.

2. Click on ***"Start"*** to run the demo on a Windows device. In this guide, a Windows10 device will be used as an example. After building the demo successfully, click the ***"Open"*** button,and select a PDF Document, then it will be opened and displayed.

## 2.4 How to Make a Windows Program in C# with ComPDFKit PDF SDK

This section will help you to quickly get started with ComPDFKit PDF SDK to make a Windows project in C# with step-by-step instructions, which include the following steps:

1. Create a new Windows project in C#.
2. Integrate ComPDFKit into your project.
3. Apply the license key.
4. Display a PDF document.

### 2.4.1 Create a New Windows Project in C#

In this guide, we use Visual Studio 2017 to create a new Windows project.

Fire up Visual Studio 2017, choose **File** -> **New** -> **Project...**, and then select **Visual C#**->**Windows Desktop** -> **WPF App(.NET Framework)** as shown in Figure 2-2.

Place the project to the location as desired. Then, click **OK**.

### 2.4.2 Integrate ComPDFKit PDF SDK into your projects

1. Copy the ***"ComPDFKit.Desk.dll"*** and ***"ComPDFKit.Viewer.dll"*** DLL files and ***"x64"*** or ***"x86"*** folder depending on your build configurations in the ***"lib"*** folder to the project ***"PdfViewer"*** folder.

2. Add ComPDFKit PDF SDK dynamic library to **References**. In order to use ComPDFKit PDF SDK APIs in the project, you must first add a reference to it.

- In Solution Explorer, right-click the ***"PdfViewer"*** project and click **Add -> Referenceâ€¦**

![Alt text](https://github.com/ComPDFKit/PDF-SDK-Windows/blob/main/images-windows/image-20220117181014260.png)

- In the Add Reference dialog, click Browse tab, navigate to the ***"PdfViewer"*** folder, select ***"ComPDFKit.Desk.dll"*** and ***"ComPDFKit.Viewer.dll"*** dynamic library, and then click **OK**.

![Alt text](https://github.com/ComPDFKit/PDF-SDK-Windows/blob/main/images-windows/image-20220207135940239.png)

3. Add ***"ComPDFKit.dll"*** to the project. Include the ***"x64"*** or ***"x86"*** folder into the project. Please make sure to set the property ***"Copy to Output Directory"*** of ***"ComPDFKit.dll"*** to ***"Copy if newer"***. Otherwise, you should copy it to the same folder with the executable file manually before running the project.

```C#
bool LicenseVerify()
{
    bool result = CPDFSDKVerifier.LoadNativeLibrary();
    if (!result)
        return false;

    string devKey = "***";
    string devSecret = "***";
    string userKey = "***";
    string userSecret = "***";
    CPDFSDKVerifier.LicenseErrorCode verifyResult = CPDFSDKVerifier.LicenseVerify(devKey, devSecret, userKey, userSecret);
    if (verifyResult != CPDFSDKVerifier.LicenseErrorCode.LICENSE_ERR_SUCCESS)
        return false;

    return true;
}
```
